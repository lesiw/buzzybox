# ðŸ¥¡ gobox: Linux utilities to-go

`gobox` is a multicall binary like `busybox` that brings basic Linux utility
support to multiple platforms. It can be run as a standalone program or imported
as a library.

## Features

* [No dependencies.](go.mod)
* [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/) compatible.
* Friendly license (MIT).

## Installation

``` sh
go install lesiw.io/gobox@latest
```

## App criteria for inclusion

One of the following:
1. The app is defined in the POSIX standard.
2. The app isnâ€™t in POSIX, but is found in multiple *nix environments, like
   MacOS, busybox, and at least one major non-busybox Linux distribution. (`tar`
   is a good example of a non-POSIX utility that is near-ubiquitous.)

And all of the following:
1. [Orthogonal](https://go.dev/talks/2010/ExpressivenessOfGo-2010.pdf): the app
   solves a problem that cannot reasonably be solved by using the existing apps
   in combination.
